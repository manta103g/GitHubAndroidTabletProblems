Problem solving in accessing GitHub via 10" Android Tablet

Hi,
trying to solve a number of issues while accessing GitHub with 10" Las Vegas Android Tablet.

1. Some repositories open with right margin cut off, so no way to get ZIP Download
2. To create new repository upper right corner menu "+" Create new... 
3. opens one time showing all options (new create new repository, new organisation)
4. another time it opens as new window and one another upper menu bar hiddens when accessed.
5. 

1. There is no link to discussions, no option to contact a developer, so repositories get no response from users, since no interaction = no interest.

1. 10" Las Vegas Android Tablet is tested as a computer like PC.
2. full PC keyboard attached, PC mouse attached, usb pendrive attached
3. tablet alone, placed on stand in vertical position, serves as 10" monitor like in case of PC.

1. My idea:
2. Implement discussions in GitHub
3. Implement developer contact
4. Implement contact with developer via Twitter by default
5. Implement sandbox for one-click running of respository apps in real time, preconfigured, to see how they perform in real life

1. Assembly a number of 12" 15" 17" tablets. No need for touch screen since I have pretested Tablet PC to perform well with PC keyboard, PC mouse attached and Las Vegas tablet to replace PC monitor.

1. Come to Las Vegas Consumer Electronic Show 2016 with new models of highly innovative
2. 12", 15", 17" Las Vegas Tablet Computers (Android OS)
